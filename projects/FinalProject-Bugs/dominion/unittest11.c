/*In the case statement for minion starting around line 955, as the rule says, it will increase action by 1, and 
then player can make choice either to gain 2 money or draw cards.  The code around line 960 calls the 
function discardCard() before the player makes the choice.  And the second issue is the 'if, else if' for 
choice 1 and choice 2 statement is not right, and should be 'if, else'*/
