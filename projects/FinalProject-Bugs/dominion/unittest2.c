/*For the Mine switch statement in the cardEffect function (around line 821), it seems that it checks the cost 
of the card they trash against the cost of the card they want to buy incorrectly.  It looks like if the cost of 
the treasure that they choose to trash plus 3, is greater than the cost of the card they want to buy, then it 
will return -1.*/
